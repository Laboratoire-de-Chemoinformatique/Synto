    Performs a tree search on a set of target molecules using specified configuration and rules,

    :param building_blocks_path: The path to the file containing building blocks.

    to find synthetic pathways for given target molecules. The results, including paths and statistics, are
    saved in the specified directory. Logging is used to record the process and any issues encountered.
